NOTES/CHALLENGES:

+lines 32-68 and 70-103 (HTML) - My primary goal was to make sure all images on the webpage had alt texts and titles
I made this possible through the use of alt attributes in the img tags and with title attributes that I learned from a classmate in breakout rooms.
I also separated img attributes line by line in HTML to make them easier for developers to read

+line 7 (HTML) - To make the title more descriptive, I changed it from "Horiseon" to "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.", to match with the webpage's footer

+line 33 (HTML) - Missing div id to make screen jump to specific section of webpage when line 17 (HTML) is clicked on

+lines 11-15 (CSS) and 12 (HTML) - Added a container for the header elements so that the background color will cover the ul when the browser is minimized

+lines 143-144 (CSS) - Commented bit about creating flex boxes to contain the 3 separate ids, because I struggled with that
